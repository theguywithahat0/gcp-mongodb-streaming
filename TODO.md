# Development Plan

## Phase 1: Configuration and Basic Setup ✅ (Completed: April 2024)
- [x] Configuration Management System
  - [x] Write tests for config loading and validation
  - [x] Implement config.py with YAML and environment support
  - [x] Add configuration schema validation
  - [x] Test environment variable integration

## Phase 2: MongoDB Integration ✅ (Completed: April 2024)
- [x] MongoDB Source Connector
  - [x] Write tests for change stream connection
  - [x] Implement MongoDB change stream reader
  - [x] Add error handling and retry logic
  - [x] Test connection stability and error recovery
- [x] Document Transformations
  - [x] Write tests for document transformation
  - [x] Implement transform logic for change stream events
  - [x] Add schema validation
  - [x] Test different document types and changes

## Phase 3: Google Cloud Pub/Sub Integration
- [ ] Pub/Sub Sink 
  - [ ] ~~Write tests for Pub/Sub publishing~~ (SKIPPED - will use native Beam)
  - [x] Implement Pub/Sub message formatting (IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT USED)
  - [ ] ~~Add batching and error handling~~ (SKIPPED - will use native Beam)
  - [ ] ~~Test message delivery and ordering~~ (SKIPPED)
- [x] Note: After evaluation, we've decided to use the native Apache Beam Pub/Sub sink instead of our custom implementation. The current PubSubSink class in src/pipeline/pubsub/sink.py is kept for reference but will not be used in the final pipeline.

## Phase 4: Apache Beam Pipeline (CURRENT FOCUS)
- [ ] Main Pipeline Implementation
  - [ ] Write tests for pipeline components
  - [ ] Implement main pipeline flow using native Beam Pub/Sub sink
  - [ ] Add monitoring and metrics
  - [ ] Test end-to-end flow with test data

## Phase 5: Scripts and Deployment
- [ ] Setup Scripts
  - [ ] Write tests for resource creation
  - [ ] Implement GCP resource setup
  - [ ] Add validation and error handling
  - [ ] Test idempotency
- [ ] Pipeline Runner
  - [ ] Write tests for pipeline execution
  - [ ] Implement pipeline runner
  - [ ] Add configuration validation
  - [ ] Test different execution modes

## Phase 6: Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Add detailed API documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## Testing Strategy
- Each component will be developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Tests will be written before implementation
- Integration tests will validate component interactions
- End-to-end tests will verify full pipeline functionality

## Branch Strategy
- main: Stable production code
- develop: Integration branch
- feature/*: Individual feature development
- test/*: Test implementation branches
- fix/*: Bug fixes

## Current Focus
1. Apache Beam Pipeline
   - Branch: feature/beam-pipeline
   - Implement pipeline components using native Beam transforms
   - Add monitoring and metrics
   - Test with sample data
