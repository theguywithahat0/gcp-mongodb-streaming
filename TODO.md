- Integration tests will validate component interactions
- End-to-end tests will verify full pipeline functionality

## Branch Strategy
- main: Stable production code
- develop: Integration branch
- feature/*: Individual feature development
- test/*: Test implementation branches
- fix/*: Bug fixes

## Current Focus
1. Document Transformations
