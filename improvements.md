# Code Quality Improvements

This document outlines potential code quality improvements and optimizations for the MongoDB Change Stream Connector.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Consistency Issues

| Issue | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Logging configuration inconsistency | Multiple files | Some files use `get_logger(__name__)` while others use `logging.getLogger(__name__)`. |

## Recommendations

### 1. Improve Consistency

- **Standardize logging approach**:
  Use `get_logger()` consistently across all modules.

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- **Add selective caching for transformation pipeline**:
  Cache results of expensive transformations for frequently accessed documents.

- **Optimize document-to-message conversion**:
  Consider using serialization libraries like msgpack or protobuf for higher performance.

### 3. Configuration Improvements

- **Add explicit configuration validation**:
  Validate all configuration values at startup to catch misconfigurations early.

- **Implement backpressure handling**:
  Add flow control mechanisms to the message batcher to handle downstream pressure.

### 4. Security Documentation

- **Document sensitive data handling**:
  - List all fields considered sensitive
  - Document transformation and masking procedures
  - Provide examples of proper field handling

- **Document data organization**:
  - Explain field prefixing conventions
  - Document warehouse/environment isolation strategies
  - Provide examples of proper namespace usage

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority (Security & Stability):**
   - Standardize logging

2. **Medium Priority (Performance):**
   - Add configuration validation
   - Implement backpressure handling

3. **Lower Priority (Optimization):**
   - Performance optimizations
   - Additional documentation
   - Caching improvements

## Testing Recommendations

After making these changes, ensure the following tests are performed:

1. Full end-to-end test with MongoDB change events
2. Security testing for sensitive field handling
3. Performance comparison before/after changes
4. Error condition testing with circuit breakers and deduplication
5. Data isolation testing between warehouses
